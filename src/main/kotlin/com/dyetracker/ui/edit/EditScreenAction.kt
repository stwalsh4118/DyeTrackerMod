/**
 * A per-feature affordance contributed to the [WidgetEditScreen] (e.g. the GIF
 * "+ Add overlay" panel). The screen shows one toolbar button per registered action; clicking
 * it activates the action, which then owns part of the screen — its own widgets, panel
 * rendering, and key handling — until it finishes or is dismissed. This keeps the generalized
 * edit screen free of any feature-specific UI.
 *
 * Implementations typically hold transient activation state (text field, in-flight job,
 * status); this is safe because the edit screen is modal and only one action is active at a
 * time. Reset that state in [onActivate]/[onDismiss].
