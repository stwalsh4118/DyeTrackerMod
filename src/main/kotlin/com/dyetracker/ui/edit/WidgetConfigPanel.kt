/**
 * A per-widget configuration panel a feature contributes for its HUD entries. It mirrors
 * [EditScreenAction]'s modal lifecycle, but instead of a global toolbar button it is bound to a
 * specific focused widget: while a widget is focused in the [WidgetEditScreen], pressing the
 * configure key opens that widget's panel — but only if its [HudWidgetEntry] supplies one
 * (entries without a panel ignore the key).
 *
 * The edit screen stays feature-agnostic: it discovers the panel from the focused entry and
 * drives it through the same render/key/ESC paths an [EditScreenAction] uses, with no knowledge
 * of any concrete feature. Implementations hold transient per-activation state (control refs);
 * reset it in [onActivate]/[onDismiss]. Activation is modal, so only one panel is live at a time.
